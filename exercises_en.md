# Labs

## Lab 1

The script to which you can gradually add the code is available here: [ex_01.py](labs/ex_01.py). The solution is available in: [ex_01_solution.py](labs/ex_01_solution.py).

We will discuss the following topics in the exercise:
* Dynamic typing
* Garbage collector

* Working environment:
  * ipython
  * Magic command,% hist

* Basic data types:
  * numbers (int, long, float, complex)
  * string:
    * immutable
    * literal for long string
    * encoding (prefix u)
* list, tuple
* dict

* Singletons: `None`, `True`, `False`

* Syntax basics:
  * Comments (+ docstring)
  * Assignment to a variable
  * Calling functions
  * print (basic `{}` substitution)
  * Conditions (possibility to bypass the absence of the switch)
  * Cycles:
    * for
    * while
  * Function definition

Recommended for practice:

A script from the 2011/2012 academic year that also includes recursion: [ex_01_extended.py](labs/ex_01_extended.py).
(solution: [cv1_labs_extended_full.py](cv1_labs_extended_full.py)).
